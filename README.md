# HobbyPromoter
## Product Overview
This is an app designed for users that are unsure what they're interested in to find and recommend hobbies for them. It does this by 
asking the user a series of questions in which we will then ask ChatGPT what it recommends based on the user's responses. Once it has 
decided what hobbies the user might like, the user can click on the one of their choice and get the description of the hobby and 
ChatGPT's opinion on if the user should get into it. The user can also ask ChatGPT questions about the hobby, like how they can get into 
the hobby and what the hobby requires.
